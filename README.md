Repository for files used in the creation of my Project

The files named in the fashion of "MetricMean.R", "MetricSD.R", "MetricMax.R", "MetricMedian.R", or "MetricMin.R", relate to the code used to make the plots for each of the network sizes for that metric.

The file named in the fashion "Individual_Metric_Plots.R" relate to the plots for each of the metrics for the origional network data used.

"Example.R" is the code used to generate the example plot of how the graphs are layed out.

"family plot.R" is the code to generate the star and friends plots

"CentralitiesPlot.R" is the code to make the centralities plot with nodes A through M in the definitions section.
