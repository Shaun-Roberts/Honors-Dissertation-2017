# Network-Project
Repository for files used in the creation of my Project

The files named in the fashion of "MetricMean.R", "MetricSD.R", "MetricMax.R", "MetricMedian.R", or "MetricMin.R", relate to the code used to make the plots for each of the network sizes for that metric.

The file named in the fashion "Individual_Metric_Plots.R" relate to the plots for each of the metrics for the origional network data used.

"Example.R" is the code used to generate the example plot of how the graphs are layed out.

"family plot.R" is the code to generate the star and friends plots

"CentralitiesPlot.R" is the code to make the centralities plot with nodes A through M in the definitions section.

"benchmarkplots.R" is the code to make the benchmarking plots.

"benchmark.R" is the code to do the benchmarks.

"individual_datasets_simualtion.R" is the code to do the simualtions for the individual origional data networks.

"simulation_expanation.R" is the code to create the simulation explanation graphs used to decribe how the simulatition process works.

"model_generation_code.R" is the code used to generate the models we used for the simulations. The models produced by you will not match those layed out in my dissertation but will be close.
